                    <p>His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for</p>
                    <p>The kind that colors the sky</p>
                    <p>Heart intangible, slips away faster</p>
                    <p>Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight</p>
                    <p>And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes</p>
                    <p>Uncovering the dreams he dreams at night</p>
                    <p>As much and hard as he tries to hide</p>
                    <p>I can see right through</p>
                    <p>See right through</p>
                    <p>His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like</p>
                    <p>I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud</p>
                    <p>What I would give for me to get my feet</p>
                    <p>Back on the ground, head off the clouds</p>
                    <p>I laugh at how we're polar opposites</p>
                    <p>I read him like a book and he's a clueless little kid</p>
                    <p>Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space</p>
                    <p>Just to make him smile</p>
                    <p>Make him smile</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't we for once</p>
                    <p>Say what we want, say what we feel?</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't you for once</p>
                    <p>Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?</p>
                    <p>Take a chance with me</p>
                    <p>Take a chance with me</p>
                    <p>Ooh</p>
                    <p>Ooh</p>
                    <p>His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for</p>
                    <p>Electricity surgin' in the air</p>
                    <p>He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me</p>
                    <p>How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware</p>
                    <p>That I'm hopelessly captivated</p>
                    <p>By a boy who thinks love's overrated</p>
                    <p>How did I get myself in this arrangement?</p>
                    <p>It baffles me too, baffles me too</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't we for once</p>
                    <p>Say what we want, say what we feel?</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't you for once</p>
                    <p>Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?</p>
                    <p>In the end, we only regret</p>
                    <p>The chances we didn't take</p>
                    <p>I'll be your safety net</p>
                    <p>So why not raise the stakes?</p>
                    <p>I can hear your heart from across the room</p>
                    <p>Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too</p>
                    <p>Lie to me all you please</p>
                    <p>I can see right through</p>
                    <p>See right through</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't we for once</p>
                    <p>Say what we want, say what we feel?</p>
                    <p>Oh, why can't you for once</p>
                    <p>Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?</p>

                    <p>Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?</p>
                    <p>Take a chance with me</p>
