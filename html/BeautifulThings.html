                  <p>For a while there, it was rough</p>
                  <p>But lately, I've been doin' better</p>
                  <p>Than the last four cold Decembers</p>
                  <p>I recall</p>
                  <p>And I see my family every month</p>
                  <p>I found a girl my parents love</p>
                  <p>She'll come and stay the night</p>
                  <p>And I think I might have it all</p>
                  <p>And I thank God every day</p>
                  <p>For the girl He sent my way</p>
                  <p>But I know the things He gives me</p>
                  <p>He can take away</p>
                  <p>And I hold you every night</p>
                  <p>And that's a feeling I wanna get used to</p>
                  <p>But there's no man as terrified</p>
                  <p>As the man who stands to lose you</p>
                  <p>Oh, I hope I don't lose you</p>
                  <p>Mm</p>
                  <p>Please stay</p>
                  <p>I want you, I need you, oh God</p>
                  <p>Don't take</p>
                  <p>These beautiful things that I've got</p>
                  <p>Please stay</p>
                  <p>I want you, I need you, oh God</p>
                  <p>Don't take</p>
                  <p>These beautiful things that I've got</p>
                  <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh</p>
                  <p>Ooh</p>
                  <p>Please don't take</p>
                  <p>I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane</p>
                  <p>It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith</p>
                  <p>If everything's good and it's great</p>
                  <p>Why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?</p>
                  <p>Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough</p>
                  <p>I've got peace and I've got love</p>
                  <p>But I'm up at night thinkin'</p>
                  <p>I just might lose it all</p>
                  <p>Please stay</p>
                  <p>I want you, I need you, oh God</p>
                  <p>Don't take</p>
                  <p>These beautiful things that I've got</p>
                  <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh</p>
                  <p>Ooh</p>
                  <p>Please stay</p>
                  <p>I want you, I need you, oh God</p>
                  <p>I need</p>
