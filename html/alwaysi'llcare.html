                    <p>Driving down the interstate</p>
                    <p>I've never felt so far away</p>
                    <p>Leaving hardly hurts at all</p>
                    <p>I'm sorry that I never call</p>
                    <p>Often I get exhausted</p>
                    <p>Trying regardless to be enough</p>
                    <p>Is it selfish not to be selfless</p>
                    <p>When all I can help is to open up?</p>
                    <p>I'll be better than I was before</p>
                    <p>Despite every text of yours ignored</p>
                    <p>Will you call me still, just to hear my voice?</p>
                    <p>I swear, always, I'll care</p>
                    <p>Flipping through our photographs</p>
                    <p>Those moments never seem to last</p>
                    <p>Listening to self control</p>
                    <p>Those feelings that you'll never know</p>
                    <p>Leave me, it's never easy</p>
                    <p>I've had a lifetime to be alone</p>
                    <p>If you let me, when it gets heavy</p>
                    <p>Know I'll never let you be all alone</p>
                    <p>I'll be better than I was before</p>
                    <p>Despite heavy texts of yours ignored</p>
                    <p>Will you call me still, just to hear my voice?</p>
                    <p>I swear, always</p>
                    <p>Always</p>
                    <p>Always, I'll care</p>
