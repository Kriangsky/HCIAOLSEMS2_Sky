                    <p>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night</p>
                    <p>You know that I caught it</p>
                    <p>Bad, bad boy</p>
                    <p>Shiny toy with a price</p>
                    <p>You know that I bought it</p>
                    <p>Killing me slow, out the window</p>
                    <p>I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below</p>
                    <p>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</p>
                    <p>What doesn't kill me makes me want you more</p>
                    <p>And it's new, the shape of your body</p>
                    <p>It's blue, the feeling I've got</p>
                    <p>And it's ooh, whoa, oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
                    <p>It's cool, that's what I tell 'em</p>
                    <p>No rules in breakable heaven</p>
                    <p>But ooh, whoa oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
                    <p>With you</p>
                    <p>Hang your head low</p>
                    <p>In the glow of the vending machine</p>
                    <p>I'm not dying</p>
                    <p>You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times</p>
                    <p>We're not trying</p>
                    <p>So cut the headlights, summer's a knife</p>
                    <p>I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone</p>
                    <p>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</p>
                    <p>And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know</p>
                    <p>Oh, it's new, the shape of your body</p>
                    <p>It's blue, the feeling I've got</p>
                    <p>And it's ooh, whoa, oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
                    <p>It's cool, that's what I tell 'em</p>
                    <p>No rules in breakable heaven</p>
                    <p>But ooh, whoa, oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
                    <p>With you</p>
                    <p>I'm drunk in the back of the car</p>
                    <p>And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)</p>
                    <p>Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true</p>
                    <p>I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you</p>
                    <p>And I snuck in through the garden gate</p>
                    <p>Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)</p>
                    <p>And I screamed for whatever it's worth</p>
                    <p>"I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?</p>
                    <p>He looks up grinning like a devil</p>
                    <p>It's new, the shape of your body</p>
                    <p>It's blue, the feeling I've got</p>
                    <p>And it's ooh, whoa, oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
                    <p>It's cool, that's what I tell 'em</p>
                    <p>No rules, in breakable heaven</p>
                    <p>But ooh, whoa, oh</p>
                    <p>It's a cruel summer</p>
