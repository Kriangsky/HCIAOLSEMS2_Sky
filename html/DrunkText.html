                    <p>5th of November</p>
                    <p>When I walked you home</p>
                    <p>That's when I nearly said it</p>
                    <p>But then said "Forget it" and froze</p>
                    <p>Do you remember?</p>
                    <p>You probably don't</p>
                    <p>'Cause the sparks in the sky</p>
                    <p>Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, drank way too much</p>
                    <p>And stayed up too late</p>
                    <p>Started to write but I wanna say</p>
                    <p>Deleted the message, but I still remember it said</p>
                    <p>I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight</p>
                    <p>Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3</p>
                    <p>And you can't fall asleep</p>
                    <p>Waiting for me to reply</p>
                    <p>I wish I was more than just someone you walk by</p>
                    <p>Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open</p>
                    <p>Instead of just hoping</p>
                    <p>You'd feel what I'm feeling inside</p>
                    <p>April the 7th</p>
                    <p>And nothing has changed</p>
                    <p>It's hard to get by</p>
                    <p>When you're still on my mind every day</p>
                    <p>Sometimes I question</p>
                    <p>If you feel the same?</p>
                    <p>Do we make stupid jokes?</p>
                    <p>Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say</p>
                    <p>I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight</p>
                    <p>Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3</p>
                    <p>And you can't fall asleep</p>
                    <p>Waiting for me to reply</p>
                    <p>I wish I was more than just someone you walk by</p>
                    <p>Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open</p>
                    <p>Instead of just hoping</p>
                    <p>You'd feel what I'm feeling inside</p>
                    <p>Oh, and here we go again</p>
                    <p>Destroy myself to keep my friend</p>
                    <p>Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no</p>
                    <p>I wonder if I cross your mind</p>
                    <p>Half as much as you do mine</p>
                    <p>If I tell you the truth</p>
                    <p>What will I lose?</p>
                    <p>I don't know</p>
                    <p>I wish I'd sent you that drunk text that midnight</p>
                    <p>I was just scared it would ruin our friendship</p>
                    <p>But I really meant it</p>
                    <p>I wonder how you would reply</p>
